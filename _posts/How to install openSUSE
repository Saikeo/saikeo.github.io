description: SEH is a mechanism within Windows that makes use of a data structure/layout called a Linked List which contains a sequence of memory locations. When a exception is triggered the OS will retrieve the head of the SEH-Chain and traverse the list and the handler will evaluate the most relevant course of action to either close the program down graceful or perform a specified action to recover from the exception.
