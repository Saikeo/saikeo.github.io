*I want to start with article by saying I set out to learn DPAPI in greater detail and I figured that writing this would help cement my existing knowledge and give me reason to learn along the way, I am no Windows expert I am simply learning as I go along and getting my head around all the different technologies & inner workings so if you notice something amiss feel free to DM me and put me right. And if you do not understand something feel free to drop me a DM and I will do my best to help :)*
